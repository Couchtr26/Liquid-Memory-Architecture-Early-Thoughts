## Future Work

* Develop simulation models for ion-path memory behavior.
* Explore combined electrical/chemical plasticity curves.
* Model noise tolerance and error correction.
* Investigate potential materials (hydrogels, ionic fluids).
* Define prototype microfluidic control systems.
* Produce 3D diagrams or CAD concept blocks.
* Expand paper into a formal pre-print.
