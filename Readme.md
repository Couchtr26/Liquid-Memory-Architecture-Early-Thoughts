Liquid/Gel-Based Memory Architecture

A conceptual framework for a next-generation memory system inspired by biological brains. Unlike rigid silicon-based storage—limited by geometric scaling, leakage, and quantum constraints—liquid and gel-based mediums allow dense, multi-layered, adaptive storage.

This project aims to define:

* a physical architecture for liquid/gel memory modules
* the mechanisms of electrical, chemical, and structural memory states
* methods for automated homeostasis using microfluidics
* the theoretical advantages in density, efficiency, and self-repair

This repository contains:

* the full whitepaper
* diagrams
* glossary
* roadmap
* references
* custom non-commercial license

This is an open research concept. **No commercial use is permitted.**
